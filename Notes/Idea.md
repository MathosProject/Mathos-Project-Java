##Test assesment system
Features
* Assessing functions for Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, (Computer Science)
* Ability to create homework
* Analytics for the teachers
* Social interactivity (share Google+)
* Assesing subjective questions based on a template (based on Zhao F.. (2008). The Algorithm Analyses and Design about the Subjective Test Online Basing on the DOM Tree. Computer Science and Software Engineering, 2008 International Conference on. Vol. 5, ss.577,581.)

##Miscellaneous
* move .NET version of Mathos to github
* test assessment - feedback system (what should you work on: give Khan Academy video)
* AbstractVector idea (KTH)
* math game
* chemistry eq. balancer (using technique described in *Elementary Linear Algebra*, section 1.8)
* math sets (set theory, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)
* vector, scalar, and quaternion
 
In case of time:
* convert all modules in the c# version to java.
