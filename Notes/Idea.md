* 
Application of calculus


Binomial coefficents
* Generating functions
* Hypergeometric functions

Combinatorics
* Sitrling Numbers
* 

Miscellaneous
* move .NET version of Mathos to github
* test assessment - feedback system (what should you work on: give Khan Academy video)
* AbstractVector idea (KTH)
* math game
* chemistry eq. balancer (using technique described in *Elementary Linear Algebra*, section 1.8)
* math sets (set theory, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)
* vector, scalar, and quaternion
 
In case of time:
* convert all modules in the c# version to java.
