Shapes (2d-shapes)
==========
All 2d-shapes should be represented as a set of functions y=f(x), x in [a,b]
In that way, we can easily find the area by integrating the functions.

Problem: what about if x = f(y).  if f(y) = constant, we simply consider it as a boundary condition for y=f(x). otherwise, these it seems to be weird.
